# Practicing React creating a single page web app
Feedback-app is a single page web app that created on the course of brad traversy.
It covers nearly all the fundamentals of react:
        1- Components
        2- props
        3- states using useState() hook.
        4- creating contexts in order to manage your states of the app
        5- using hooks like >> useContext, useEffect
        6- Also Creating a mock app Backend API

## Fisrt install react using the following command and use the following other commands I will mention after it to create your own app:
        1- npx create-react-app my-app
        2- npm install react-router=dom >> for routing and creating pages for your app if you need like home and about pages.
        3- npm install react-icons >> if you need icons for your app like fontawesome library icons.
        4- npm start >> to start your app Happy Coding!!!

### for trying my feedback-app as a demo you can find it in the following link:

N.B >>>> the mock API will work only when you setup this app in your localhost:
        1- git clone and the link of my repo
        2- npm install
        3- npm run dev >> because I used concurrently package in order to run both the app and the database concurrently.
